Make existing and freshly created Behave reports available over HTTP

Install:
  * locally: ./setup_pbl.py
  * remotely: ansible-playbook -i host,[host2[,host3]] setup_pbl.yml

httpd should now listen on port 8080 and make available existing and
freshly created logs. This is done by publish_behave_logs service that
monitors /tmp for close_write events and copies report_*.html files to
httpd document root with modification time stamp added to file name so
that you can see results of repeated run of a single test.
